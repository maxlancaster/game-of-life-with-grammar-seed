      <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
      <h3>Seeded by Basic 2D Grammars</h3>
        <!-- <p>Welcome to Conway's Game of Life. Here are the rules: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
      Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
      Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
      Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
      Select a grammar by clicking on one of the sets of rules below. Once you select a rule, you'll get to choose a different computation of that rule to use as a seed to the game. Click squares to bring them to life or kill them off.</p> -->
