Visualizing Urbanization with 2D Shape Grammars and Conway's Game of Life
======

Motivation: Combine shapes, spatial relations and 2D grammars with Conwayâ€™s Game of Life to explore how cities move and breathe over generations.

This was my final project for 4.520: Visual Computing I.

Version 1 can be used to model two types of developments: Suburbia and Metropolis.
